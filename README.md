Article_Summarizer

My APP requires you to put URL of the website that you want to summarize 📖,
it uses web scraping 🧹 (via an API 🔮) and summarizes the webpage and stores it in localStorage of your BROWSER 💻. 

//NOTE : THIS WONT WORK FOR WEBSITE THAT HAS ANTI-SCRAPING TOOLS ENABLE (as such websites do not want bots traffic on their site they enable these tools or they may have other reasons to do so)
